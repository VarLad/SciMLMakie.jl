# SciMLMakie.jl
This repo implements Makie recipe for SciML ecosystem. The supported kwargs and parameters are the same as the Plots.jl recipe. 

To install

```
]add https://github.com/VarLad/SciMLMakie.jl
```

Please note that because Makie has no concept of Axis, any Axis related features in the recipe are not to be expected from the implementation. Although the recipes can easily be used with the Axis. 

Please refer to [this notebook]( https://htmlview.glitch.me/?https://github.com/VarLad/SciMLMakie.jl/blob/master/assets/demo.html ) for a few examples.
